## Introduction 

This project is aimed at providing a comprehensive collection of common data structures and algorithms implemented in Python. It serves as a learning resource for those interested in understanding and practicing fundamental computer science concepts. 

## Data Structures 

The following data structures are implemented in this repository:

- [Linked List](./linked_list/) 🔗
- [Stack](./stack/) 🔺
- [Queue](./queue/) 🔁
- [Binary Tree](./binary_tree/) 🌳
- [Hash Table](./hash_table/) 🔒
- [Heap](./heap/) 🗻
- [Graph](./graph/) 🕸️

Each data structure has its own directory within the repository, containing the implementation and accompanying tests.

## Algorithms

The following algorithms are implemented in this repository:

- [Sorting Algorithms](./sorting/) 🔢
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- [Searching Algorithms](./searching/) 🔍
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
- [Graph Algorithms](./graph/) 🕸️
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Kruskal's Algorithm

Similar to the data structures, each algorithm has its own directory within the repository, containing the implementation and accompanying tests.

## Usage

To use the data structures and algorithms in your own projects, simply navigate to the respective directory and import the necessary modules. Each module is self-contained and can be used independently.

For example, to use the Linked List implementation, you can import it like this:

```python
from linked_list.linked_list import LinkedList
```

Refer to the individual README files within each directory for more detailed usage instructions.

## Contributing 🤝

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for new data structures or algorithms to be included, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

When contributing, please ensure that:

1. Your code follows the project's coding style and conventions.
2. You add comprehensive tests for your implementation.
3. You update the README files with any necessary documentation.
